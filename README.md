Rails Workshop
===

This project was an exercise (with given specs) to rewrite the inner workings of rails.

Cool things learned
===

+ WEBrick, building HTTPResponces and what exactly is in an HTTPRequest.

+ How ApplicationController (here called controller_base.rb) deals with rendering and sessions.

+ WEBrick::cookies are nice

+ parsing params is easy with regular expressions

+ the router really ties everything together
